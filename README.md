# Detection of Lung Cancer cells

Final year undegraduate degree thesis.

The project is concerned with ‘Analysis of Malignant Tumours for Lung Cancer patients’, expediting the early detection of lung cancer being the objective which is to be achieved. The pros and cons about CT texture analysis have been explored and have concluded that CTTA is one of the prominent techniques to be further discovered for detection of lung cancer.

This project consists of three salient steps:

1. Image preprocessing
2. Texture feature extraction
3. Machine Learning

The project has experimented the following methods:
